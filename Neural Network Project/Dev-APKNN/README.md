This is a Neural Networking using Keras with Tensorflow in the background.

I am running the network on a dataset that was run on drebins program. 

NN1 is a model that focuses on Recall score.
NN2 is a model that focuses on reducing Benign false postives while maintaining a respectable Recall score.

Logs and charts include for each model.
